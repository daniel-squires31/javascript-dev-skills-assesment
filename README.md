# Swell Javascript Developer Skills Assessment
Hello, congrats on being identified as a potential employee of Swell. You were sent this skills assessment as a way to identify your current strengths and weaknesses as a potential hire for Swell as a Javascript Software Engineer. Doing well on this assessment is absolutely critical to receiving a job offer.

## Required Skills
- Git version control system
- Javascript and/or Typescript
- One of the four frameworks/libraries: React, Angular(2+), Vue, or Svelte for front-end work.

## Rules
1. It should only take about 3-10 hours to complete the assessment. If you need more time, that is allowed, however the amount of time from your first commit to last will be used to assess you as a candidate for the position. Only start the assessment when you are ready to give it your full attention.
2. You may use any code or text editor to complete the assessment you choose. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a free choice.
3. You may use Javascript or Typescript, and any library or framework to complete the assessment.
4. You may consult anybody and anything to help you with your assessment, including google, developer documentation, stackoverflow, etc. However, it will be apparent if you use copy-pasta code, and your unique code style will be part of your assessment. If somebody else's code makes up the majority of you deliverable, then it will be grounds for dismissal as an interview candidate or after hiring.
5. If you use others' code (i.e. Stack overflow answers), make sure you credit the author/answer in comments inline with your work

## Assessment Scenario
Swell has recently been contracted by a local high school to build a scoreboard portal for their team. They plan on using this website so visitors can navigate to the page during live games, and displaying it on a digital scoreboard at their games. You have been tasked with building this.

You may use Javascript or Typescript for a programming language, and React, Angular(2+), Vue, or Svelte as a framework/library choice.

The scoreboard needs the following features:
- A public web page where individuals can see the current score.
- An admin page where game referees can add events to the scoreboard:
    - Add team names
    - End current down
    - Change in current yards
    - Team control of the ball changeover
    - Field goal score
    - Touchdown score
- Actions of the events above should reflect on the UI of the scoreboard based on the current state of the game. (I.E. ending a down on the fourth down should automatically trigger a ball changeover.)
- You can find the rules of football [here](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2020-nfl-rulebook/).

You have not been given designs for this project.

## Criteria
You will not be judged on:
- Technology or framework/library choice of the choices listed in the rules section (unless otherwise specified by the job description)
- Look/feel of the application.
- Security/deployment concerns (though that would be a bonus).
- Use of boilerplate code generators or additional code libraries.

You WILL be judged on:
- How long did it take the candidate to complete the assessment?
- Does the application build? Are there warnings or errors?
- Does the application work as expected **IMPORTANT**?
- Is there a public page for viewing the current scores/downs/yard **IMPORTANT**?
- Is there an admin page for changing the team info/scores/downs/yards **IMPORTANT**?
- Does updating the score on the admin page reflect in both places?
- How is state persisted between pages?
- Is state persistent regardless of who visits the page **OPTIONAL**?
- Code quality and consistency of style.
- Code readability. 
- Compliance with linters and industry standards. As an example, using `eslint:recommended` would be preferred.
- State management rules simplicity.
